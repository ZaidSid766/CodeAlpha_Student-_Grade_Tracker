# Student Grade Tracker ðŸŽ“

The Student Grade Tracker is a beginner-friendly Java program designed to simplify grade management for teachers. 
This application allows users to input a specified number of student grades, validates the inputs, 
and computes essential statistics such as the average, highest, and lowest grades.

## Key Features:
- **User-Friendly Input**: Teachers can enter a specific number of grades, ensuring organized data collection.
- **Validation**: Ensures all grades are between 0 and 100, with clear error messages for invalid inputs.
- **Dynamic Data Handling**: Uses an `ArrayList` for efficient storage and processing of grades.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Automatically calculates the average grade, the highest score, and the lowest score for better insights.

## How It Works:
1. The program prompts the teacher to specify the number of grades to enter.
2. Validates each grade to ensure it is within the range of 0 to 100.
3. Calculates:
   - Average grade
   - Highest grade
   - Lowest grade
4. Outputs the results in a clear and user-friendly format.

## Ideal Use Case:
This project demonstrates fundamental programming concepts like loops, conditionals, arrays, and basic input validation, 
making it an excellent choice for beginners learning Java. Itâ€™s lightweight, interactive, and can be easily extended with additional features, 
such as exporting results or analyzing trends over multiple inputs.

Perfect for small classroom management or as a learning project to enhance your Java programming skills! ðŸ˜Š
